# AGENTS

- When asked to implement a milestone, evaluate whether the work should be split into separate PRs.
- If a milestone is too large for a single PR, explicitly say so before implementing and provide a breakdown of the milestone into smaller sub-steps/PRs.
- After each PR-sized diff is implemented, stop and hand off immediately so the user can review and commit before continuing to the next PR-sized chunk.
- Unit tests are required for everything; every code change should be validated with unit tests.
- After implementing work, always summarize exactly what was built and include how it can be manually verified in the app.
